<h3>Hi :wave:, I'm Paige</h3>
This is my personal site built with GitHub Pages. I am excited to start my journey in coding and sharing projects.

On this site, I'll be learning how to use GitHub, exploring new technologies, and sharing my progress.  
Feel free to look around as I add more content and projects over time.

Thank you for visiting!
